            <p>I love being able to give back to the communities around me, whether that is at Texas A&M or back home. Here are a few ways I've been involved:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li><a href="sec.tamu.edu">Student Engineers' Council</a>, Student Relations Chair - In this position, I have worked towards putting on events related to mental health as well as DE&I.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.awics.org/">Aggie Women in Computer Science</a>, Mentor - I have been a mentor for other girls in Computer Science with similar college experiences as me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a> - I've enjoyed volunteering at this TAMU tradition each year! It's especially fun volunteering with a large group, or when the family has kids or pets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pianist - Back home, I play piano at a memory care unit. Getting to see the elderly interact with music that they had long forgotten is an experience I will forever hold near to my heart. 
                </li>
            </ul>
