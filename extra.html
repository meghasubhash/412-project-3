            <p>Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. You can learn more about me, my technical experience, and my involvement in my communities. This website is my first project I have to do in a class I am taking called CSCE 315 - Programming Studio.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a junior (c/o ’25) Computer Science major at Texas A&M University, but I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I attended Carroll Senior High School and graduated in 2021. I went to A&M with the intention of majoring in Computer Science, but had a very unorthodox experience with the ETAM process (ask me about it sometime!). Now, I’m starting my junior year and I’ve done a lot during my time here. I just finished my first internship at Collins Aerospace as a Software Engineering Intern, and have been involved in Aggie Women in Computer Science (AWiCS) and the Student Engineers’ Council (SEC).

                        I played piano and violin growing up, and love listening to music now when I'm working out or studying. Or when I'm walking around campus or in the car. Really at any time. I will try any type of music at least once so my playlists are usually pretty sporadic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/meghasubhash11">Check out my spotify!</a>

                        I love going on walks outside. I try my best to get over 10,000 steps every day (which is a lot easier when I'm walking all over campus!). My favorite place back home to walk is <a href="https://www.grapevinetexasusa.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/lake-grapevine/"> Grapevine Lake</a>. There are a lot of great trails to walk there.

                        I read a LOT. I wish I read more nonfiction or self-help books, but if I'm honest, I am a sucker for a romance book. One of my favorite series when I was in high school is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10507293-the-selection">The Selection Series</a>, which actually might get turned into a movie now!
