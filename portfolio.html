            <h3> My Internship Experience:</h3>
            <p> I worked at <a href="https://www.collinsaerospace.com/">Collins Aerospace</a> this past summer (Summer 2023). It was a good introduction to the defense industry. The plane that my team worked on is called the <a href="https://www.navair.navy.mil/product/E-6B-Mercury">E-6B Mercury</a>. I learned a lot and my favorite project that I worked on was a Python script that extracted and analyzed data elements from complex data sets. This helped to improve data processing by 70%.</p>

            <h3> My Personal Projects:</h3>
            <p>AWiCS Membership Hub - currently working on creating a membership hub using NodeJS and React to track attendance and inform members of upcoming events.</p>
            <p>Personal Blog - learned how to host a website publicly and learned how to use HTML and CSS</p>
